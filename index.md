<p>WADComs is an interactive cheat sheet, containing a curated list of offensive security tools and their respective commands, to be used against Windows/AD environments.</p>  

<p>If you hate constantly looking up the right command to use against a Windows or Active Directory environment (like me), this project should help ease the pain a bit. Just select what information you currently have related to the Windows machine (passwords, usernames, services, etc.), and it will display a list of tools you can try against the machine, along with a template command for easy copy/pasting. See the full list of [items](/items/) and [filters](/filters/).</p>

This project was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnWoodman15">John Woodman</a> and was inspired by <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/">GTFOBins</a> and <a href="https://lolbas-project.github.io">LOLBAS</a>. I relied heavily on <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io">GTFOBins'</a> site template to make this one.

I'm hoping to make WADComs a <a href="(https://github.com/WADComs/WADComs.github.io">collaborative project</a>, so please feel free to <a href="/contribute/">contribute</a> your commands.
